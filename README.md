# FNLauncher
A simple Fortnite launcher to bypass the "Fortnite was not started correctly and needs to be closed" error on old versions (5.00+).
This project is for educational purposes only. If you are an Epic Games employee and have an issue with this please open a GitHub issue.

# How to use?
The compiled .exe in "Actions" expects your game to be located at "C:\users\<user>\.fnlauncher\7.40". 
If you want to use this to start an old version you have to fork this repo, change the Windows path at lines 46 and 47 and wait for GitHub actions to build FNLauncher.

# Safety
FNLauncher may get flagged by your antivirus software as malware: it's just a false flag and you're safe to add FNLauncher to your exclusions (**only** if you've downloaded this from a trusted source).

# Contributing
You are free to open an issue in case you need help with this or open a pull request if you want to help me improve FNLauncher.
