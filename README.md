# FNLauncher
A simple Fortnite launcher to bypass the "Fortnite was not started correctly and needs to be closed" error on old versions (5.00+).

# How to use?
The compiled .exe in "Actions" expects your game to be located at "C:\users\<user>\.fnlauncher\7.40". 
If you want to use this to start an old version you have to fork this repo, change the Windows path at lines 46 and 47 and wait for GitHub actions to build FNLauncher.

# Safety
FNLauncher may get flagged by your antivirus software as malware: it's just a false flag and you're safe to add FNLauncher to your exclusions (**only** if you've downloaded this from a trusted source).
